# RPG-Town
This game is a copy of a mobile game with similar name, the mobile game is an idle type of game and it's pretty simple, and i thought it would be a great idea for me to "recreate" it so i can learn more of c++

In case you're wondering why there's a folder called "yeah dude", i just didn't have a creative name when i created the project so i put yeah dude

Not compatible with Linux yet, but you can compile with g++ if you want, it should work perfectly if you follow the [wiki](https://github.com/DannyXjsu/RPG-Town/wiki/Building-in-Linux)
